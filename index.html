    <h3>About Me</h3>
    
        
        My name is Kishore Reddy, and I recently graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in 2023. My college years were a transformative period, filled with rigorous academic challenges and enriching experiences. I was actively involved in various technical clubs and projects, which honed my problem-solving skills and teamwork abilities. 
        
        During my time at college, I developed a strong foundation in engineering principles while also discovering a passion for technology and coding. This led me to pursue a career in front-end development. I have since completed several Udemy courses, focusing on HTML & CSS, JavaScript, AngularJS, and ReactJS. These courses have provided me with the tools to create dynamic and user-friendly web applications.
        
        I am excited to combine my engineering background with my newly acquired front-end development skills to contribute to innovative projects and continuously learn and grow in the tech industry.
